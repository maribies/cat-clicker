## Overview

This is a project developed for the Udacity Front End Nano Degree program to practice front end development skills.

The requirements are to display a picture of a cat and the number of clicks. (Which should increase with every click.) The specs of the layout don't matter, so I can style it as I desire.

I've tried to use CSS grid to style the layout to test my abilities, as I am very comfortable with flexbox, but not as much with grid. 

## How to Run
To run:
1. Download or clone the GitHub file to your local
2. Open the index.html file from the download in your browser

## Contributing
This repository is for me to develop my skills as a Udacity student. Therefore, I will most likely not accept pull requests. (At least not until after my submission has been reviewed for completion towards my nanodegree program.)

## Code dependancies
JavaScript. Might not be compatible with all browsers and assistive technologies. yet.

## Resources Used
google. of course. &&
all documentation ever.
&& my brain, which has grown in capacity the last few months as I've progressed through the Udacity nanodegree program.
